# 👋 Yo, I'm Belal!

### 💡 I like making things that are fun, useful, or just plain cool.

- 🎮 I enjoy building games and browser experiments
- 📦 I work on weird, retro, and creative projects
- 🤖 I love AI ideas — tools like GPT-4o, DeepSeek, and beyond
- 🛠️ Still learning HTML, CSS, JS, and Python — but I build anyway

## ⚡ Featured Project

### 🧨 [Particle Playground](https://github.com/Belal-21/Particle-Playground)
A cool visual sandbox where particles bounce, collide, and do their thing in pure JS. Try it out, tweak it, break it, or remix it!
